## What is BoxLog?

## Key Features

### Structured Logging
Capture rich, structured logs with context that makes debugging a breeze:

```typescript
// Simple logging with BoxLog
import { BoxLog } from '@boxlog/sdk'

const logger = new BoxLog({
  apiKey: process.env.BOXLOG_API_KEY
})

logger.info('User action completed', {
  userId: user.id,
  action: 'purchase',
  amount: 99.99,
  metadata: { itemId: 'prod_123' }
})
```

### Real-time Log Streaming
Watch logs as they happen with our real-time streaming capabilities:

```javascript
// Subscribe to real-time logs
const stream = logger.stream({
  filter: { level: 'error', service: 'api' },
  onLog: (log) => {
    console.log('New log entry:', log)
    // React to errors immediately
  }
})
```

### Powerful Search & Analytics
Query your logs with our intuitive search syntax:

```javascript
// Search logs with advanced filters
const results = await logger.search({
  query: 'error AND service:payment',
  timeRange: '24h',

    errorsByEndpoint: {
      terms: { field: 'endpoint' }
